# CarRC
Bluetooth LE Controlled Car made with Arduino

This is an afternoon project to build a RC car which can be controlled with a mobile phone. I have used the following hardware:

* Arduino Uno
* L293D
* Adafruit Bluefruit LE UART Friend
* 2 DC motors
* Portable 5V Power Supply

For more information about the Bluetooth LE module [read this](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/introducing-the-adafruit-bluefruit-le-uart-friend.pdf).
The software is based on the Controller example project. For more information about how to control it, read the `.ino` file
